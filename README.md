# Assignment-One:
# Linear Regression Analysis of the Obesity Dataset

This repository contains all code, figures, and the written report for a college assignment analyzing the **UCI Estimation of Obesity Levels** dataset.  
The goal is to predict **body weight (kg)** using demographic and lifestyle factors and to compare the performance of two linear regression models.

## Project Overview
- **Dataset**: [UCI Machine Learning Repository – Estimation of Obesity Levels](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/544/estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition)  
- **Data Source for Code**: The raw CSV is loaded directly from this GitHub repository’s `raw` link so that the notebook runs without local files.  
- **Objective**: Explore the dataset, clean and preprocess the data, then build and evaluate  
  1. **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Regressor**  
  2. **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression**

The analysis was completed in **Google Colab**
